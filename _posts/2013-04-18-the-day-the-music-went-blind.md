The soundtrack of my youth was illustrated by [Storm Thorgerson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Thorgerson).

I cannot listen to _Darkside of the Moon_ without seeing the prism. Just one bar of _Wish You Were Here_ conjures visions of the burning man.  The same is true with _Animals_, _Atom Heart Mother_, and non-Floyd greats by bands like Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Alan Parsons, Phish, and many, many others.

When I hear the tunes, I see the album art.

Storm's art.

Music stores are the galleries that display his work.  The images fill our iTunes libraries with art that reminds us of what we were doing the first time we listened to these iconic albums.

Storm died today.

A part of the music died with him.
