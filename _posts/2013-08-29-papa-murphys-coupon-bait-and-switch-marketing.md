Pizza is a competitive business. There are national chains, local pizzerias, regional preferences, delivery, pickup, and DiGiorno.  When it comes to pizza, my son and I are constantly on the prowl for the next best slice.

For years we've overlooked Papa Murphy's. For the uninitiated, Papa Murphy's is a place where they make a raw pizza for you, and then you bring it home and bake it.  This has typically turned us off, but tonight was just me and little man, and this sounded fun.

So we went online to order a pie.  The menu looked good, and we quickly settled on a Chicago style 5 meat stuffed pizza.  No online ordering available for our area, but it was fairly quick and painless to find the local franchisee's phone number.

There was a link for coupons, so I clicked it.

A pdf appears, with $11 large 5 Meat Stuffed pizza.  Winner winner chicken dinner.

We called, told the person on the phone we had a coupon for an $11 large 5-Meat Stuffed Pizza.  They told us we could upgrade to a family sized pie, about 30% larger, for $2, making our order only $13.  Sold.  We'll take it I say.

"Do I need to print the coupon?", I ask.

"We'd appreciate it if you do", they replied. "Your pizza will be ready in 15 minutes."

So I did.  I printed the thing.  I never print coupons.  It was a pain, but I did it.  I doubted it was necessary, but if it keeps them from having to print one later, or give one to someone else, I guess I could do it.  I was next to a printer after all.

We drove roughly 10 miles to go retrieve this pizza, excited about our new adventure into take-and-bake pizza.  Despite afternoon traffic, we make it there with little effort and stroll in to grab our prize.

The coupon sitting on my desk at home.

I tell the counter person my name, they retrieve our raw pizza pie, and ring me up at $16 + tax.  I explain about the online coupon that I printed, but forgot at home.

I am told no coupon, no discount.

I explain the coupon is from [PapaMurphys.com](http://PapaMurphys.com), the corporate website, and I can show on my phone.

No coupon, no discount.

I asked if this was 1993, before people had websites?

No coupon, no discount.

They then explain that if they don't have a printed, physical copy, corporate wont refund them, so they can't accept a cell phone screen.

I ask why they don't just have a stack of printed coupons?  They could have them behind the counter for people like me.

Sorry. No coupon, no...yeah, I get it.

I don't know what the cost of customer acquisition for Papa Murphy, but for $3 they just lost this customer, and my pizza is still in the oven.

Why?  Because now all I feel is punished.  I wasted 5 minutes of my life hooking up my printer, wasting ink on this full color page of coupons, only to forget it and be _up-charged_ three bucks for doing so.  That is a horrible customer experience.  I went on an adventure with my kid, and now I am brooding over being slapped on the wrist for forgetting a coupon that Papa Murphy's puts on their own corporate website, for the love of Pizza.

It is only $3, I know, but that is over 20% in markup from my original quoted price.  And I now have a six-pack of coupons that'll never get used.

What does three bucks get you these days?  A blog post rant, it seems.

Next time, I'll order [Papa John's](http://papajohns.com).
