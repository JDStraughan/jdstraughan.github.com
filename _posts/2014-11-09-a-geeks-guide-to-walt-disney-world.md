My family and I are Disney fanatics, Earheads, Disneyphiles, whatever you wish to call us. Our close friend and family already know. Interventions are futile, we have consumed the Mouse's Kool-Aid, and we are not turning back.

We are annual pass-holders, members of the Disney Vacation Club (DVC), and the de-facto Disney experts of our social group. We even bought some Disney stock.

There are plenty of folks that have spent way more time at Disney Parks than we have, and these answers are based on my experiences at the parks with my family. We spend the majority of our vacation time at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, however, I have also visited Disneyland in California and Disney Paris.

Our dream is a round-the-world trip to all 5 Disney Parks in one trip. We'll see if that ever happens.

Below are the questions most frequently asked of me by friends and family that are planning a trip to Walt Disney World.

## Why do you keep going to Walt Disney World?

This is the most often asked question from folks when they find out about our obsession. The answer is simple: _it is a great place for both kids and adults_.

> We believed in our idea - a family park where parents and children could have fun - together.
>
> Walt Disney

Each of the parks offer many attractions geared towards adults, with fun for the kids at every corner; The Magic Kingdom brings Disney classics to life, Hollywood Studios personifies the golden age of movies (and has a few roller coaters), Animal Kingdom brings the zoo into the 21st century, and EPCOT is the adult paradise of tomorrow.

### Magic Kingdom

Undoubtedly, the best way to visit Magic Kingdom is with, or as, a kid. Fantasyland makes classic Disney tangible with rides like Peter Pan and the Seven Dwarf's Mine Train. Tomorrowland is best at night, with the futuristic neon lighting the way to Carousel of Progress, The Monsters Inc Laugh Floor, and Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin. Adventureland's Pirates of the Caribbean is a family favorite, and a Dole Whip is welcome in any weather. If you have younger kiddos with you, The Jungle Cruise is a fun treat. Frontierland has two great rides, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Splash Mountain, and Tom Sawyer Island makes for a good wind-down spot. Don't forget to watch the classic Country Bear Jamboree.

If you can get a spot for lunch or dinner, use the Fastpass+ or a dining reservation for Be Our Guest. If you have children with you, especially young princesses, this restaurant is a must see.

There are other night shows at Walt Disney World, but the best fireworks are certainly at Magic Kingdom. The current night show _Wishes_ is worth waiting for. Grab a spot on Main Street, preferably by the Partners statue, and prepare to be amazed.

### EPCOT

Epcot, originally EPCOT Center, stands for the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. It began as Walt's dream of a futuristic city, and has become a perpetual world's fair for the last 30 plus years.

I visited Epcot shortly after its debut as a child, and it was love at first sight. The future, the world, innovation and technology presented in an interactive way I had never experienced before. I visited again as a young man, and now, as an adult, it still astonishes me on every visit.

Over twice the size of Magic Kingdom, Epcot is broken into two sections: Future World and World Showcase.

#### Future World

Future World is broken into sections, and has changed dramatically since I was a child. Like a living expo, you can expect to see new technologies on display every few years. Many of the attractions have been updated or replaced as new innovations and sponsorships have emerged.

Spaceship Earth is the "big sphere" that stands as the iconic symbol for the park. Inside is a ride that restores faith in human beings while reminding riders of our achievements over the past several thousand years. It is a must ride for me every visit, sometimes it is my first and last ride of the day.

Rides like Mission: SPACE, Test Track, and Sorin offer bigger kids and adults more thrilling experience while The Seas with Nemo and Friends, Universe of Energy, and The Land are slower paced, and small child friendly rides that offer educational opportunities.

Imagination pavilion has our family's favorite character, Figment. This ride has also changed over the years, but the message is eternal: progress is driven by imagination.

Lastly, Innoventions is a great place to escape the weather and see presentations and interactive exhibits from various sponsors. The Sum of all Thrills is a personal favorite, allowing you to build your own roller coaster and then ride it in a virtual simulation.

#### World Showcase

The eleven countries represented at EPCOT's world showcase each offer shopping, entertainment, food and drinks from their homeland. Enjoying some unique refreshments while strolling around World Showcase Lagoon keeps the adults happy and Kidcot allows kids to create personalized souvenirs at each country. There is also an interactive game, [Agent P's World Showcase Adventure](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/epcot/agent-p-world-showcase-adventure/) to keep the young detectives busy while exploring the shops and themed areas of each country.

### Hollywood Studios

I was fortunate to visit Hollywood Studios the year it opened, when it was still called _MGM Studios_, and will always remember being an extra in the _Indiana Jones Stunt Show_. It was especially fun to watch my son, and then my wife and sister all participate in this same show experience decades later.

Set in Hollywood's golden age, this park brings Star Wars, Indiana Jones, The Muppet's, Pixar's Toy Story, and Hollywood's great movies all together. Star Tours is a must ride for any Star Wars fan, and kids under 14 can train as a padawan in the Jedi Training Academy.

The shows are amazing, Indiana Jones brings _The Raiders of the Lost Ark_ to life, with audience participation included. The Lights, Motor, Action stunt show is fun every time, and Beauty and the Beast is a favorite for my family.

Be sure to take the time to enjoy The Great Movie Ride. A trip through the Hollywood greats is the perfect way to set the stage for a great day in movie-land.

If you only have time to ride one thing in this park, it must be Toy Story Midway Mania. This ride is epic, bringing 3D gaming to a new level. The queuing area is fun, but a Fastpass makes this ride so much better.

Fantasmic is the Hollywood Studios closing show, and my son thinks it is the best thing in all Disney. When he first saw the show he was six years old and it was days after Christmas. He turned to me at the end of Fantasmic and said "Mickey Mouse has more magic than Santa Claus". To this day it is his favorite show.

If you are going to eat at the park, be sure to get a Fantasmic Dinner Package for better seats. We have had incredible seats many times, and it really makes a difference to have the dining package in my opinion.

### Animal Kingdom

Animal Kingdom is far better than any zoo I have ever visited in terms of interaction with the world around you - it especially magnificent. The opportunities for education are everywhere, with conservation and awareness in the forefront of every attraction.

The Kilimanjaro Safari is a great ride to hit first thing in the morning. We usually get a Fastpass for the first hour, and when the park opens, we go straight to the standby line, ride it, then use our Fastpass to ride it a second time. Once the morning is over, the animals are harder to see, and the experience is not as nice, so the earlier the better in our experience.

We enjoy eating at Tusker House, grabbing one of the better buffets in Walt Disney World. It is a character dining experience, with Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy. If you are on the dining plan, this is a good value if your children enjoy the character experience. The food ranges from traditional Disney buffet options to unique African offerings.

The Maharajah Jungle Trek is a great way to get see some tigers and other wild animals. It requires a bit of walking, but it is worth every step and is very well shaded. The best part is you can enjoy it at whatever pace you choose. We also like the Flights of Wonder bird show, where a variety of birds are presented by knowledgeable keepers and researchers.

Expedition Everest is a good roller coaster, with a cool queue full of authentic gear from Mount Everest. It is one of the better coasters at Walt Disney World, and is a replica of the same attraction from Disneyland in California.

DINOSAUR is one of my son's favorite rides, where you take a time machine back to prehistoric earth and bring back an Iguanodon seconds before a major extinction event.

At the time of this writing, there is not a closing show at this park. It is rumored that one is coming soon.

## Should we stay on property?

There are several benefits from staying at a Walt Disney World resort.

### Disney Magical Express

We do not rent a car when we travel to Walt Disney World. Months before we leave, we add out flight information to our _My Disney Experience_ app, alerting Disney of our travel times. They send yellow luggage tags with our names and resort information on them, and we keep them for our day of travel.

Our typical travel day is pretty simple. We try to catch the flight that will get us to Orlando the earliest. We tag our bags with the yellow luggage tags they sent, and check them at the airport. We check as many of our bags as we can, depending on the airline we are flying.

When we arrive at Orlando International Airport, we simply go down to the Disney Magical Express counter, skipping baggage claim. We board a bus to our resort, and watch classic Disney cartoons while enjoying the view of central Florida.
    
When we arrive at our resort, we quickly check-in using the express on-line check-in line, and then go to our room to drop off our personal items to relax for a bit. Then we are free to go to the park of our choice, or enjoy some of the resort amenities. Our bags will all arrive in our room in 4-5 hours, whether we are there or not.

Disney's Magical Express is free both to and from the airport and the resorts on property offer airline check-in for your return flight, including baggage services. On the morning we leave, we simply check our bags, get our boarding passes, and then enjoy our day until the time for our bus to the airport. Because the resort will also hold any personal items, we usually can squeeze in brunch at one of the parks on our final day.

### Transportation at the Parks

Once at the parks, we have never found a real need for a rental car. We may get one in a future trip to explore Universal and other areas, but for years we have been happy enjoying the Disney experience completely on property. Not having to worry about directions, driving, parking, traffic, etc makes for a better vacation for me and my family. Thankfully, they make it very easy to get to all the parks, resorts, and Downtown Disney through a myriad of transportation options.

#### Buses

The bus system can be frustrating at times, but in the vast majority of cases it is very convenient to grab a bus from your resort to any of the parks, or vice-versa. Wait times are typically under 20 minutes, however, at peak times (like park closing time) it may take several buses to accommodate the waiting crowd.

#### Monorail

The monorail is a fun way to travel between Magic Kingdom and the connected resorts: the Contemporary, Polynesian Village, Fort Wilderness Lodge, and the Grand Floridian. This same line also connects to the Transportation and Ticket Center, where you can catch another monorail line to Epcot.

#### Boats

The ferries are a great way to travel around Walt Disney World.

Magic Kingdom offers water taxis to and from the Grand Floridian, Polynesian Village, Fort Wilderness Campground, and Wilderness Lodge. You can also take ferryboats from Magic Kingdom to the Transportation and Ticket Center.

Epcot and Hollywood Studios are connected by boat to the Boardwalk Inn and Villas, Yacht and Beach Club resorts, and the Swan and Dolphin Hotels.

Port Orleans (both the French Quarter and Riverside), and DVC resorts Old Key West and Saratoga Springs also offer boats to Downtown Disney.

#### Taxis

The Transportation and Ticket Center, Animal Kingdom and Epcot always have plenty of taxis on hand. If there is not one at your resort, one can be there quickly after a quick stop at the concierge desk. We have used the taxis a couple of times, usually when we did not want to wait on a long bus line or had a reservation we are running to catch.

### Resort Delivery

This really is a major perk of staying on property - if you purchase (most) merchandise from anywhere in the parks, you can have it shipped to your resort instead of carrying it around all day. This does not work on your last day in the resort as all deliveries arrive around 3PM the following day. We take advantage of resort delivery with the majority of our purchases.

Other options available to all guests are delivery to the front of the park (usually takes a few hours) where they will hold your bags for pickup, or the lesser known home delivery. When we purchase large or fragile items, we fill out a form and ship our items home, where they usually arrive in 1 - 2 weeks.

### Extra Magic Hours

All resort guests enjoy the benefit of Extra Magic Hours. Every day one park will either open early or stay open late for resort guests only. These times have less crowds, and are a great way to enjoy some of the rides and attractions that may be hard to manage during regular park hours. We plan which park we visit each day on several factors, and Extra Magic Hours plays a big part in that decision making process.

### Magic Bands

Each resort guest is now issued a _magic band_ &mdash; a "smart" wristband that can perform many tasks including
- Admission to parks (with linked passes)
- PhotoPass or MemoryMaker card replacement
- Room key (the band unlocks your room door!)
- Dining plan "card"
- Room charges when you have a credit card on file
- Fastpass+ admission

We have experienced the parks both with and without the MagicBands. We were lucky enough to "test" them at a resort early in their existence, and they are quite cool. Added features now include videos on several rides included in your MemoryMaker, and all ride photos magically appear in your MemoryMaker when you wear your magic band on the ride.

### Disney Service

An important reason we stay on property is the legendary Disney service. Our vacation dollar is well spent when we compare the service we receive from Disney compared to other vacation experiences, dollar for dollar, and this certainly extends to their resorts and hotels. We have stayed at value, moderate, and deluxe properties. We are now DVC members with our home resort at Saratoga Springs, and have visited many of the DVC resorts as well. I can say that the level of Disney service is stellar, no matter where you stay on site.

### Special Offers and Add-ons

The Disney Travel Company offers several vacation package offers throughout the year that can make a sizable difference in the cost of a Disney vacation, especially if you can travel during the slower seasons. Other add-ons include the ability to participate in the dining plans and memory maker programs.

## Where do you book your trips?

For our first two trips we used a travel agent, but now we use the Disney Travel Company.

The advantages to using this service are ease of use, discounts, and My Disney Experience.

## What time of year should you go?

It is easier to answer which time of year to avoid: summer, Christmas, and New Years.

## What is Downtown Disney?

Downtown Disney is a fairly large area of shops and restaurants ranging from Disney merchandise to the Lego store. Some of the restaurants participate in the Disney dining plan, and many of the shops offer merchandise that is hard to find in the parks. Buses and water taxis provide transpiration to and from Disney resort hotels, making this shopping wonderland easy to experience. We have found this destination to be a better place for adults, especially those that enjoy shopping and nightlife. We are not frequent visitors to this area, however, it is a good place to go if you want to get away from the parks and hotels for a few hours.

## Do you use the Disney Dining Plan?

We have, but it is not for everyone. To qualify for the plan, you must be staying at a resort on property.

The dining plan can be advantageous if your family like to eat a lot, and you use the plan wisely. Our main reason for using it is it allows us to prepay for most of our food, reducing the stress of keeping up with finances during the vacation. To get the most "bang for the buck" we usually order the more expensive menu options for each meal when we are on a dining plan. 

If you go during the _International Food and Wine Festival_ or _Flower and Garden Festival_, the food kiosks accept snack credits for many of the food offerings. We have found this is a great way to use our snack credits, especially if we order bottled waters and food from the Garden Grocer (see below).

#### Tables in Wonderland

If you are not opting to use one of the Disney Dining Plans, you may want to consider purchasing a _Tables in Wonderland_ card.

## Which restaurants should we eat at?

Since there are over 135 restaurants at Walt Disney World, it would take more than a blog post to cover them all. There are restaurants to suit almost every genre, atmosphere, and price range. In this post I will share some of our family's favorite places, but I would not consider this an exhaustive guide by any stretch of the imagination.

Disney restaurants fall into two main categories: table service and quick service. Table service restaurants can be either buffets or menu, with the latter offering servers to deliver your food. Quick service restaurants are more akin to fast food, with the meals rapidly available for the guest.

Our family usually eats breakfast at the resort, often fruit and pastry from the Garden Grocer (see below), a quick service for lunch, and a table service for dinner.

### Magic Kingdom

The Magic Kingdom offers a variety of dining atmospheres, with themes ranging from perpetual Thanksgiving at the Liberty Tree Tavern to the space age entertainment of Cosmic Ray at his Starlight Café.

#### Table Service

If you want to enjoy one of the table service restaurants at the Magic Kingdom than reservations are advised, especially for dinner service. Each trip we make, we watch dozens of people be politely turned away from restaurants while we wait to be seated. Tens of thousands of people visit the Magic Kingdom every day, and there are limited seats at their seven table service restaurants.

The Crystal Palace features Winnie the Pooh and friends with a large buffet and dining area. This one of our favorite table service restaurants in the Kingdom, and is a great place to start or end a day at the park. They are open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

We love to eat at Be Our Guest, enjoying one of the three spectacular dining rooms. The Grand Ballroom offers fantastic Gothic architecture, the West Wing allows dining next to the Beast's enchanted rose, and Belle's library has a relaxing mood. The food is great, and of course, they have the gray stuff. Like Cinderella's Royal Table, this restaurant will book up 6 months out.

Tony's Town Square is themed from the movie where the most famous kiss in animated storytelling happened, Lady and the Tramp. In the back corner of the restaurant, you can look out the window and see Tramp dining with his Lady, enjoying some pasta for two. The menu offers Italian favorites, and on an nice evening, an outdoor table is a great way to soak in Main Street.

### Epcot

#### Future World

#### World Showcase

### Hollywood Studios

### Animal Kingdom

## When should we book our reservations?

Like all things Disney, the more you plan ahead, the easier your vacation will be. We usually begin planning our next trip at least a year in advance, deciding on dates and exploring our options as soon as we can.

### Resort Reservations

If you are booking online, the website does restrict how far out you can book your trip, so you may have to check back often to see when the next year's pricing is released. Generally this is each summer, so 2016 trips will not become available until sometime in summer of 2015. You can call for booking a trip up to 500 days in advance, but we usually just use the website and have not had any problems. Our rooms are usually booked 7-11 months in advance.

If you are traveling during the off-season, there may be special offers for free dining, upgraded resorts, or other perks. We usually book ahead of the specials, then call in when the specials are announced to receive a refund or upgrade.

#### Dining Reservations

We book these 180 days from the first day of our vacation. The trick here is you can get reservations for all the days of your trip on this magical day, and if you are trying to get into one of the more coveted restaurants on property, sometimes even this is not enough. Guests that are staying for longer trips may have already taken all the available reservations for the restaurant of your choice. In this case, we always grab a backup, and then check back often for a table to open up.

We have found that around 21-30 days out we have a good chance of grabbing the table we wanted. It seems a significant number of people change their plans at the last minute.

#### Fastpass+

The Fastpass is your ticket to ride &mdash; it allows you to take an often significantly shorter line to enter the attractions of your choice. You can book three Fastpasses per day, up to 30 days before your first day in the park. After you run out of Fastpasses, you can visit a Fastpass+ kiosk to try and get more, but only after you have used all of your experiences. We try to reserve our Fastpass+ times as early as we can for the attractions we must see, and then attempt to book more as allowed.

## How long should we stay?

This really depends on your family, what all you wish to see in Orlando, and your tolerance for fun (and crowds). Our typical stay is nine days, including travel. With four parks, tons of resort amenities, Downtown Disney, the Boardwalk, and all the other areas, we find a few days is not enough. At the very least, I would recommend taking a full day in each park.

## Any money saving tips?

Every Disney vacation starts with a budget. To help us maximize our dollar, we opt to save where we can so we have more to spend while in the parks.

### Book a Cheap Flight

Using travel sites or airline miles, we always go for the cheapest flight we can find, since the shortest amount of our vacation time will be spent on the plane. Because of where we live, we typically fly Southwest. This allows us to check two bags each, and the non-stop flights to Orlando are usually the cheapest.

### Grocery Delivery

Bottled water, granola bars, fresh fruit, and other snacks and refreshments are more expensive on property than most convenience stores. To save money, we usually order these items from [GardenGrocer.com](https://www.gardengrocer.com/) and have them delivered to our resort. Using the in room refrigerator we have a constant supply of cold water, fruit, and snacks. This small trick saves us time and money every year.

### Quick Service to the Airport

Since we usually try to get an afternoon flight home, allowing us a breakfast or brunch in the park prior to returning home, we like to have our final Disney meal at the airport. It may be debatable if this is a money saving tip, however, we tend to save a quick service meal credit from our dining plan and make our final order at the resort's quick service counter prior to boarding the bus. They will gladly pack up the meals to go, with plates and cutlery, bagged up and ready for your trip home.

## Any other things worth passing on?

Be nice - use good manners
