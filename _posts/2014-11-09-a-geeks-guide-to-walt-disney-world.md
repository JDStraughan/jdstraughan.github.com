My family and I just returned from our fifth trip to see The Mouse in the last 3 years, for a total of 45 days in the park, not including trips as a kid.  We have 3 more trips planned in the next 12 months. I also spent one day at Disney Paris last August, unfortunately I was there without my family. We are now annual passholders, members of the Disney Vacation Club (DVC), and the de-facto Disney experts of our friends and family. We even bought some Disney stock.

There are plenty of folks that have spent way more time at Disney, and these answers are based on my experiences at the parks with my family. Below are the questions most frequently asked of me by friends and family that are planning a trip to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.

## Why do you keep going to Walt Disney World?

This is the most often asked question from folks when they find out about our obsession. The answer is simple: _it is a great place for both kids and adults_.

> We believed in our idea - a family park where parents and children could have fun- together.
>
> Walt Disney

Each of the parks offer many parks and attractions geared towards adults, with fun for the kids at every corner; The Magic Kingom brings Disney classics to life, Hollywood Studios personifies the golden age of movies (and has a few roller costers), Animal Kingdom brings the zoo into the 21st century, and EPCOT is the adult paradise of tomorrow.

### Magic Kingdom

Undoubtedly, the best way to visit Magic Kingdom is with, or as, a kid. Fantasyland makes classic Disney tangable with rides like Peter Pan and the Seven Dwarf's Mine Train. Tomorrowland is best at night, with the futuristic neon lighting the way to Carousel of Progress, The Monsters Inc Laugh Floor, and Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin. Adventureland's Pirates of the Caribbean is a family favorite, and a Dole Whip is welcome in any weather. If you have younger kiddos with you, The Jungle Cruise is a fun treat. Frontierland has two great rides, Big Thunder Mountain Railroad and Splash Mountain, and Tom Sawyer Island makes for a good wind-down spot. Don't forget to watch the classic Country Bear Jamboree.

If you can get a spot for lunch or dinner, use the Fastpass+ or a dining reservation for Be Our Guest. If you have children with you, especially young princesses, this restaurant is a must see.

There are other night shows at Walt Disney World, but the best fireworks are certainly at Magic Kingdom. The current night show _Wishes_ is worth waiting for. Grab a spot on Main Street, preferrably by the Partners statue, and prepare to be amazed.

### EPCOT

Epcot, originally EPCOT Center, is the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. It began as Walt's dream of a futuristic city, and has become a perpetual world's fair for the last 30 plus years.

I visited Epcot shortly after its debut as a child, and it was love at first sight. The future, the world, innovation and technology presented in an interactive way I had never experienced before. I visited again as a young man, and now, as an adult, it still astonishes me on every visit.

Over twice the size of Magic Kingdom, Epcot is broken into two sections: Future World and World Showcase.

#### Future World

Future World is broken into sections, and has changed dramatically since I was a child. Like any technology expo, you can expect to see new technologies on display every few years, and many of the attractions have been updated or replaced as new technologies have emerged.

Spaceship Earth is the "big sphere" that stands as the iconic symbol for the park. Inside is a ride that restores faith in human beings while reminding riders of our achievements over the past several thousand years. It is a must ride for me every visit, sometimes it is my first and last ride of the day.

Rides like Mission: SPACE, Test Track, and Sorin offer bigger kids and adults more thrilling experience while The Seas with Nemo and Friends, Universe of Energy, and The Land are slower paced, and small child friendly rides that offer educational oppertunities.

Imagination pavilion has our family's favorite character, Figment, and the class Michael Jackson, Francis Ford-Coppola, and George Lucas creation: Captian EO.

Lastly, Innoventions is a great place to escape the weather and see presentations and interactive exhibits from various sponsers. The Sum of all Thrills is a personal favorite, allowing you to build your own roller coaster and then ride it in a virtual simulation.

#### World Showcase

The eleven countries represented at EPCOT's world showcase each offer food and drinks from their homeland. Enjoying some unique refreshments while strolling around World Showcase Lagoon keeps the adults happy, Kidcot allows kids to create personalized souvenirs at each country. There is also an interactive game, [Agent P's World Showcase Adventure](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/epcot/agent-p-world-showcase-adventure/) to keep the young detectives active.

### Hollywood Studios

I was fortunate to visit Hollywood Studios the year it opened, when it was still called _MGM Studios_, and will always remember being an extra in the _Indiana Jones Stunt Show_. It was especially fun to watch my son, and then my wife and sister all participate in this same show experience decades later.

Set in Hollywood's golden age, this park brings Star Wars, Indiana Jones, The Muppets, Pixar's Toy Story, and Hollywood's great movies all together. Star Tours is a must ride for any Star Wars fan, and kids under 14 can train as a padawan in the Jedi Training Academy.

The shows are amazing, Indiana Jones brings The Lost Ark to life, with audience participation included. The Lights, Motor, Action stunt show is fun every time, and Beauty and the Beast is a favorite for my family.

The Great Movie Ride is reportedly scheduled for closure, and if you are visiting while it is still rolling, be sure to take the time to ride it. A trip through the Hollywood greats is the perfect way to take in the original aspects of this park.

If you only have time to ride one thing in this park, it must be Toy Story Midway Mania. This ride is epic, bringing 3D gaming to a new level. The queueing line is fun, but a fastpass makes this ride so much better.

Fantasmic is the Hollywood Studios closing show, and my son thinks it is the best thing in all Disney. When he first saw the show he was six years old and it was days after Christmas. He turned to me at the end of Fantasmic and said "Mickey Mouse has more magic than Santa Claus". If you are going to eat at the park, be sure to get a Fantasmic Dinner Package for better seats. We have sat in the first 10 rows many times, and it really makes a difference.

### Animal Kingdom

In all fairness, Animal Kingdom is my least favorite park. This being said, it is far better than any zoo I've ever visited, in terms of interaction especially. The oppertunities for education are everywhere, with conservation and awareness in the forefront.

The Kilimangaro Safari is a great ride to hit first thing. We usually get a fastpass for the first hour, and when the park opens, we go straight to the standby line, ride it, then use our fastpass to ride it a second time. Once the morning is over, the animals are harder to see, and the experience is not as nice, so the earlier the better in our experience.

We enjoy eating at Tusker House, grabbing one of the better buffets in Walt Disney World. It is a character dining experience, with Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy. If you are on the dining plan, this is a good value if your children enjoy the character experience. The food ranges from tranditional Disney buffet options to unique African offerings.

The Maharajah Jungle Trek is a great way to get see some tigers and other wild animals. It requires a bit of walking, but it is worth every step, and is very well shaded. The best part is you can enjoy it at whatever pace you choose. We also like the Flights of Wonder bird show, where a variety of birds are presented by knowledgeble keepers and researchers.

Expedition Everest is a good roller coaster, with a cool queue full of authentic gear from Mount Everest. It is one of the better coasters at Walt Disney World, and is a replica of the same attraction from Disneyland in California.

DINOSAUR is one of my son's favorite rides, where you take a time machine back to prehistoric earth and bring back an Iguanadon seconds before a major extention event.

At the time of this writing, there is not a closing show at this park. It is rumored that one is coming soon.
