Last week I delivered a [talk at InnoTech San Antonio](http://www.innotechconferences.com/sanantonio/?tracks=the-future-of-cloud-programming-is-serverless-and-concurrent), the Business & Technology Innovation Conference & Exposition, about the future of cloud programming. There are some very interesting technologies that are available to us today that are certainly going to have a huge impact on the norms of cloud programming in the years to come.

While Moore’s Law continues to bring us faster computers, it comes in the form of more cores and faster phones. As software becomes more ubiquitous it becomes more reliant on infrastructures that can scale quickly and are affordable.

Emerging technologies are making it easier and cheaper to use cloud resources. Amazon’s AWS Lambda, Google’s Azure Functions, and Google’s Firebase offer out of the box solutions that make creating highly scalable backends easy. Serving near real-time concurrent requests on modest hardware can be accomplished with languages like Elixir, Clojure, and Haskell, taking advantage of resources like never before.

In this talk we covered:

- Using concurrency to maximize hardware (Elixir, Clojure, Haskell)
- Serverless technologies for backend architecture (Amazon AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure Cloud Functions)
- BaaS &mdash; Backend as a Service (Google Firebase, etc)
