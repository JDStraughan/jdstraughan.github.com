## Our First Trip

We went to see the Mouse. Christmas was barely over when we boarded our flights and headed off to the land of magic and mice. Our biggest takeaway is that we will be back, but not during the New Years celebrations.

### A Magical Time

This trip was certainly everything we hoped it would be, and more. Despite being newbies that made absolutely no plans, and being at the parks on some of the busiest days of the entire year, Disney often made us feel like the most important guests in the park.

I'm not sure how they keep those smiles with the crowds, but they did go above and beyond to make sure every guest was attended to.

This was our first real family vacation, in the traditional sense. We worked hard and saved for this trip, and we wanted to get every moment we could out of it. Early mornings, waiting on rope-drop, then closing down the park with fireworks and last minute shopping. If it could be done, we did it.

### Happy New Year

We "celebrated" New Years Eve at Epcot.
