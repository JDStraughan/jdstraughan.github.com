title: NoNews Part II - The Source
tags: ["chrome extension", "javascript"]
excerpt: "NoNews is my first browser extension - you can read more about why I wrote it in another post.  This post is focused on the how: source code, methodologies, and roadmaps.  NoNews is open source, and very simple under the hood.  If you are a noob extension developer like me, I hope this article helps you see what I learned on my first adventure into the world of browser extensions, and if you are a veteran, I hope you can contribute to making NoNews better - or at least point out where I could do better."

No news, as the title and aphorism declare, is often good news.
