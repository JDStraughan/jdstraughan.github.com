  <h3>Who am I?</h3>

  <p>I am a father and husband that loves to cook food with fire and prefers clean code over a clean desk. I'd describe myself as a LEGO building, code writing, barbecuing, Disney World enthusiast that loves entrepreneurship.</p>

  <p>There's something about creating the future that excites me.</p>

  <p>I am the CEO of Codeup, a career accelerator that trains software development to students with little to no prior programming experience in 18 weeks with a 90% job placement rate.</p>
