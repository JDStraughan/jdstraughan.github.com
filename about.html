  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>As founder of Grok Interactive, I have assembled a team of software engineers with proven talent in web development.</p>

  <p>As co-founder of Codeup.com, I am part of a team that is training the new web developers in modern technology.</p>

  <p>I have lead development teams in the social networking and Software as a Service (SaaS) spaces to successful product launches over the course of my career. I've worked on projects with clients and firms including the Wounded Warrior Project, US Army, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the San Antonio Spurs, and startups including DynastyOwner.com and Pressable.com.</p>

  <p>I am also the author of the first published book on the Kohana PHP Framework, "Beginning Kohana 3.0 Development", released in 2011 by Packt Publishing, and the co-author of the curriculum used at the Codeup.com web development bootcamp.
  </p>

  <p>I would love to discuss your next web development project. Please contact me at jasons@grok-interactive.com or 210-775-1218.</p>

  <p>When I am not sitting in front of my computer creating awesomeness, I can usually be found playing disc golf with my 7 year old son, building legos (sometimes with my 7 year old son), or goofing off with electronics, like the arduino.</p>
