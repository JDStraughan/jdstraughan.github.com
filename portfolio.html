<h1>Portfolio</h1>

<p>The projects listed here represent only a fraction of my overall experience as I am not able to share many of my most interesting and challenging projects due to privacy agreements, works in progress, or public availability.  While many of these sites were developed in a team environment, I have attributed each project to the company that developed the site and have described my contributions.  Feel free to contact me regarding my role in each project, or any questions you may have.  </p>

		<p>MyCommunify is a support app on steroids. It combines status updates (Pulse), an interactive question app (Answers), a twitter based app for your company (OrgTweet), a rating and review module (FirstRate), SMS messaging, email notifications, branded urls and custom subdomains, beta features too early to disclose, and maybe an alien death ray.  This app truly embraces the customer, and has been as fun to build as it has to use.</p>
		<p>My contributions included development on the Pulse module, FirstRate module, SMS integration, email notifications, admin sections, public users, db fun, twitter oAuth, bug fixes, and various unreleased features.</p>
