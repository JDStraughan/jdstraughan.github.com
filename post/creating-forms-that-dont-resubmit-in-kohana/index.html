<h1 class="post">Creating forms that don't resubmit in Kohana</h1>
<p class="date_published">30 Mar 2011</p>
<div id="post">
	<p>It is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;one of my pet peeves: reloading a page only to see the "Confirm Form Resubmission" alert box that wants me to find my mouse and click on something that could have easily been prevented by the developer. &nbsp;This is 2011, for crying out loud, can't we have forms that don't suck?</p>

<p>The easiest solution to this problem is to load all posted form data into the session, and then reload the page internally. &nbsp;This clears the POST request while maintaining the submission and makes for happier users (and less headaches about the same comment submitted 14 times in a row).</p>

<p>Using Kohana's Session class makes it even simpler to remedy this ill of the internet. &nbsp;It really does not matter which driver you use, simply create a session and drop in the submission. &nbsp;The following controller action demonstrates the basics of this feature:</p>

{% highlight php %}
<?php defined('SYSPATH') or die('No direct script access.');

class Controller_Form extends Controller {

	public function action_test()
	{
		$session = Session::instance();
		
		$example = new Model_Example;
		
		$this->template->content = View::factory('form/test')
			->bind('post', $post)
			->bind('errors', $errors);
		
		if ($_POST)
		{
			
			$post = $example->validate($_POST);
			
			if ($post->check())
			{
				// Process Form
				$this->session->set('post', array());
				Request::instance()->redirect(url::site('somewhere'));
			} 
			else
			{
				$this->session->set('errors', $e->errors());
				$this->session->set('post', $_POST);
				Request::instance()->redirect(url::site('back-here'));
			}
		} 
		elseif ($this->session->get('post')) 
		{
			$_POST = $this->session->get('post');
			$errors = $this->session->get('errors');
			$this->session->delete('post');
			$this->session->delete('errors');
		}
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now a simple view script with a form is all that is needed to complete this exercise.  Although this is really just pseudo-code, I hope you get the idea.</p>

<p>To see this in action, fill out the comment section below, but leave the email input blank. &nbsp;The form will have errors, the messages will be displayed, the from will remain sticky (you other data will persist), but a refresh of the page will not show any resubmission warnings. &nbsp;Hopefully, this makes you a happier user.  If not, let me know by commenting below, and feel free to ask any questions.</p></div>

				I like the way of writting but there's a catch with the session key you're using: you should point users to use the actual form's name for it so that they can still normally use other forms after validation in this one fails (example).			</p>

				@kemo: That is a very good point.  I named the session 'post' key as it is really just psuedo-code, and wanted people to understand the concept.  I agree that in a real world scenario the session keys should be unique to the form being used.			</p>
